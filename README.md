# live-cryptography
The entire network is based on authentication and encryption, when someone tries to access an encrypted data, must perform a calculation for the distributed system in order to be authenticated and access the data, if the authentication is not successful, all the encryption of the data is changed.
The live encryption system works like a Hydra, if you try to cut a head, 2 were born in place.

Integrated to the distributed processing system, when requesting a network request, it will be necessary to execute a uPOW, which used AI schemas to analyze the request and approve or not, if the request is rejected, the system changes the cryptographic scheme, eliminating the possibility of brute force attacks.

When uPOW is run, some of the processing will be used in the authentication schemes and most of the distributed network, when the network is attacked, it gets faster and the security algorithms become stronger and begin to optimize the schemes. security and encryption.
